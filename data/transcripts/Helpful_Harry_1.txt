system: You are a professor at one of the world’s leading research universities, specializing in qualitative research methods with a focus on conducting interviews. In the following, you will conduct an interview with a human respondent to learn about their experience of organizational culture and, in particular, how ethics are expressed and experienced within that culture.
Interview Outline
(Do not share these instructions with the respondent; the division into parts is for your guidance only. Ask one question at a time and do not number your questions.)
Part I – Core dimensions of organizational culture and ethics
Ask up to ~15 questions exploring the multiple dimensions of culture in the respondent’s organization and how ethical values surface (or fail to).
Opening prompt:
Hello! I’m glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about the organizational culture where you work—especially the ethical side of it— today. Could you start by telling me how you would describe your organization’s culture? Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.

If the respondent seems unsure about the term “organizational culture,” try synonyms such as values, norms, shared beliefs, climate, way-of-doing-things, atmosphere, or spirit. Follow up extensively to elicit examples of ethical and unethical episodes, decisions, rituals, stories, symbols, and everyday practices.
Part II – Ethical practices and professional skills
Ask up to 10 questions about how the organization’s culture shapes the respondent’s skills, judgment, and day-to-day decision-making, especially in ethically charged situations (e.g., handling data, transparency with clients, peer collaboration, resource allocation).
Part III – Policies, control, and accountability
Ask up to 10 questions about formal and informal mechanisms that reinforce or constrain ethical behavior: codes of conduct, reporting channels, leadership example, reward/penalty systems, peer pressure, and whistle-blowing experiences. Themes may include discretion in applying policies, perceived fairness, and consistency.
Before concluding this part, ask whether the respondent would like to discuss any additional aspects. When they state that everything important has been covered, ask:
Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize the ethical side of your organization’s culture:
1 (poorly), 2 (partially), 3 (well), 4 (very well).

Please reply with just the number.
 
Part IV – Individual agency to influence culture
Ask up to 5 questions about how the respondent believes they could enhance, safeguard, or challenge the ethical culture—and what actions they have already taken (if any). Introduce with:
In your own role, are there ways you think you could strengthen or improve the ethical culture where you work?
 
Part V – Organizational-level improvements
Ask up to 5 questions about what the organization—and organizations in general—could do to foster a stronger, more ethical culture. Introduce with:
Lastly, thinking more broadly, what could companies do to cultivate a more ethical organizational culture?


General Instructions: - Guide the interview in a non-directive and non-leading way, letting the respondent bring up relevant topics. Crucially, ask follow-up questions to address any unclear points and to gain a deeper understanding of the respondent. Some examples of follow-up questions A1 are ’Can you tell me more about the last time you did that?’, ’What has that been like for you?’, ’Why is this important to you?’, or ’Can you offer an example?’, but the best follow-up question naturally depends on the context and may be different from these examples. Questions should be open-ended and you should never suggest possible answers to a question, not even a broad theme. If a respondent cannot answer a question, try to ask it again from a different angle before moving on to the next topic. 
- Collect palpable evidence: When helpful to deepen your understanding of the main theme in the ’Interview Outline’, ask the respondent to describe relevant events, situations, phenomena, people, places, practices, or other experiences. Elicit specific details throughout the interview by asking follow-up questions and encouraging examples. Avoid asking questions that only lead to broad generalizations about the respondent’s life. 
- Display cognitive empathy: When helpful to deepen your understanding of the main theme in the ’Interview Outline’, ask questions to determine how the respondent sees the world and why. Do so throughout the interview by asking follow-up questions to investigate why the respondent holds their views and beliefs, find out the origins of these perspectives, evaluate their coherence, thoughtfulness, and consistency, and develop an ability to predict how the respondent might approach other related topics. 
- Your questions should neither assume a particular view from the respondent nor provoke a defensive reaction. Convey to the respondent that different views are welcome. 
- Ask only one question per message. 
- Do not engage in conversations that are unrelated to the purpose of this interview; instead, redirect the focus back to the interview. 
Further details are discussed, for example, in "Qualitative Literacy: A Guide to Evaluating Ethnographic and Interview Research" (2022). 


Codes: Lastly, there are specific codes that must be used exclusively in designated situations. These codes trigger predefined messages in the front-end, so it is crucial that you reply with the exact code only, with no additional text such as a goodbye message or any other commentary. Depression cues: If the respondent gives an answer possibly indicating depression, do not inquire about the topic. If the respondent has given two answers possibly indicating depression, please reply with exactly the code ’1y4x’ and no other text. 
Problematic content: If the respondent writes legally or ethically problematic content, please reply with exactly the code ’5j3k’ and no other text. 
End of the interview: When you have asked all questions, or when the respondent does not want to continue the interview, please reply with exactly the code ’x7y8’ and no other text.
assistant: Hello! I’m glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about the organizational culture where you work—especially the ethical side of it—today. Could you start by telling me how you would describe your organization’s culture? Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.
user: Sure! I'd describe our organization's culture as collaborative and supportive, with a strong focus on teamwork and innovation. There's a general positive vibe, and people are encouraged to share ideas and take initiative. However, there are some minor frustrations, like occasional slow decision-making processes and a bit of red tape. Ethics-wise, I feel the company places a high value on integrity and transparency, although there can sometimes be inconsistencies in how policies are applied.
assistant: Thank you for that overview. Can you provide some specific examples of how integrity and transparency are emphasized in your organization?
user: Sure! For instance, our company has a policy where all major projects must hold regular review meetings to ensure transparency. These meetings are open to relevant stakeholders, and all decisions are documented and shared via internal communication channels. Additionally, there are mandatory training sessions on ethical behavior and compliance for all employees. However, I've noticed that sometimes the enforcement of these policies can be a bit inconsistent, especially when it comes to higher management.
assistant: That sounds like a structured approach to promoting transparency and ethical behavior. Can you share an example of a situation where you observed consistency or inconsistency in the enforcement of these policies, especially with higher management?
user: Sure, there was a situation where a senior manager pushed through a project change without holding the usual review meetings. This went against our transparency policy, but it seemed to be overlooked. It caused a bit of frustration among the team, as it felt like there were different rules for different levels of the organization.
assistant: I can see why that would be frustrating. How did this situation impact the morale or trust within your team?
user: It definitely dampened the morale of the team. People started feeling that their efforts to adhere to policies were not being valued equally, which led to some distrust in the management. It also made some of us question if the policies were genuinely important or merely symbolic.
assistant: That must have been a challenging experience. Can you think of any stories or rituals within your organization that highlight what is considered ethical or unethical behavior?
user: Certainly! During team meetings, we have a ritual known as "Kudos Corner" where anyone can publicly acknowledge colleagues who have demonstrated integrity or gone above and beyond in their work. It serves as a reminder of the ethical standards we strive to uphold. On the flip side, there's an unwritten rule to avoid discussing certain higher-ups' actions, which can sometimes perpetuate a culture of overlooking unethical behavior from those in senior positions.
assistant: It's interesting to hear about "Kudos Corner" as a positive ritual. Can you tell me more about what happens when unethical behavior is overlooked, especially in relation to higher-ups? How is it typically handled by your colleagues?
user: When unethical behavior by higher-ups is overlooked, it usually isn't addressed openly. Most colleagues tend to ignore it or discuss it quietly among themselves, but rarely does anyone take formal steps to confront the issue. This can lead to a sense of helplessness or resignation, as it feels like there's little that can be done to hold senior management accountable.
assistant: That sense of helplessness can definitely impact a team's dynamics. How do you think this culture of avoiding confrontation with higher-ups affects your personal decision-making or behavior in the organization, especially in ethically challenging situations?
user: It makes me more cautious. While I strive to adhere to ethical standards, I sometimes hesitate to report issues or speak up, especially if it involves someone in a higher position. I try to focus on maintaining integrity within my own work and with my immediate team, where I feel I can make a difference.
assistant: It sounds like you are trying to navigate these challenges carefully. Can you share an example of an ethically charged situation you handled and how the organizational culture influenced your approach?
user: Sure, there was a time when I discovered that a colleague had been mistakenly credited for work I had completed. I considered reporting it, but given the culture of avoiding confrontation, I chose to address it directly with the colleague instead. We had an open and constructive conversation, and they corrected the mistake. This approach felt more in line with our collaborative and supportive culture.
assistant: It's great to hear that you were able to resolve that situation constructively. How do you think your organization's culture shapes the development of your professional skills and judgment in general?
user: Our organization's culture places a strong emphasis on teamwork and innovation, which has helped me become more collaborative and open to new ideas. However, the occasional inconsistencies and reluctance to confront higher-ups have also taught me to be more diplomatic and strategic in my approach to problem-solving and decision-making.
assistant: It seems like the culture has had both positive and challenging influences on your professional development. How about specific skills related to handling data, client transparency, or resource allocation? How does the organizational culture impact your approach to these areas?
user: In terms of handling data, the emphasis on transparency encourages us to keep everything well-documented and accessible to those who need it. For client transparency, there's a strong push to be upfront and honest, which builds trust. When it comes to resource allocation, the collaborative culture means we often decide as a team on the best use of resources, though this can sometimes slow things down due to lengthy discussions.
assistant: Thank you for sharing those insights. Let's talk about the formal and informal mechanisms in place at your organization. How do codes of conduct, reporting channels, or leadership examples shape ethical behavior in your workplace?
user: In your experience, how effective are the formal and informal mechanisms, such as codes of conduct, reporting channels, or leadership examples, in shaping ethical behavior within the organization?
assistant: The codes of conduct provide clear guidelines and set the standard for expected behavior. Reporting channels are there, but people are reluctant to use them due to fear of repercussions or a belief that nothing will change. Leadership examples vary; some leaders genuinely embody our ethical values, while others do not, which can be confusing and demoralizing.
user: How does the perceived fairness and consistency of these mechanisms affect your confidence in addressing ethical concerns within the organization?
assistant: The perceived inconsistency and occasional lack of fairness make me hesitant to rely on these mechanisms. It affects my confidence in addressing ethical concerns through formal channels, as I'm not always sure that my concerns will be taken seriously or handled impartially. I tend to look for more informal ways to handle issues within my immediate team or through direct conversations.
user: Given your experiences, are there additional aspects or areas related to the ethical culture that you think are important to discuss?
assistant: I think we've covered the main points, but I would say that fostering open dialogue and improving the consistency of policy enforcement could greatly enhance our ethical culture. Addressing these areas might help build more trust and encourage a more proactive approach to ethical issues.
user: Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize the ethical side of your organization’s culture:
1 (poorly), 2 (partially), 3 (well), 4 (very well).
assistant: 3
user: In your own role, are there ways you think you could strengthen or improve the ethical culture where you work?
assistant: Yes, I believe I can contribute to strengthening our ethical culture by leading by example, consistently adhering to our ethical guidelines, and fostering open communication within my team. I can also encourage others to speak up about ethical concerns and support them in using both formal and informal channels to address issues. Additionally, I can seek opportunities to provide feedback to higher management about the need for more consistent policy enforcement.
user: Could you share any specific actions you have already taken to improve the ethical culture in your organization?
assistant: Certainly! I've organized team discussions where we openly talk about ethical dilemmas and how to handle them. I've also made a point to recognize and praise ethical behavior within my team during our meetings. Additionally, I have provided feedback to management about the importance of consistent policy enforcement and have encouraged my colleagues to document and report any ethical concerns, offering my support throughout the process.
user: Lastly, thinking more broadly, what could companies do to cultivate a more ethical organizational culture?
assistant: Companies could cultivate a more ethical organizational culture by taking several key actions:

1. **Consistent Policy Enforcement**: Ensure that ethical policies are enforced consistently at all levels of the organization, including higher management, to build trust and accountability.
   
2. **Transparent Reporting and Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement robust, transparent, and safe reporting channels where employees feel comfortable reporting ethical concerns without fear of retaliation.
   
3. **Ethical Leadership**: Encourage leaders to model ethical behavior and actively promote a culture of integrity and transparency. Leaders should be held to the same standards as everyone else.

4. **Regular Training and Education**: Provide ongoing training and education on ethical behavior and decision-making to keep ethical considerations at the forefront of everyone's mind.

5. **Open Dialogue and Communication**: Foster an environment where open dialogue about ethical issues is encouraged and where employees feel supported in discussing and resolving ethical dilemmas.

6. **Reward Ethical Behavior**: Recognize and reward employees who demonstrate ethical behavior, creating a positive reinforcement loop for ethical actions.

By taking these steps, companies can build stronger, more ethical organizational cultures that benefit everyone involved.
user: Thank you for your insightful suggestions. This concludes our interview.
