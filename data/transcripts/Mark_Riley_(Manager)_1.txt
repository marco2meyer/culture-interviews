assistant: Hello! I’m glad to have the opportunity to speak with you about the organizational culture where you work—especially the ethical side of it—today. Could you start by telling me how you would describe your organization’s culture? Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear.
user: The culture at KPMG is fast-paced, performance-driven, and highly focused on delivering results. Ethical standards are emphasized, but the real challenge is maintaining them under tight deadlines and budget constraints.
assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Can you describe a specific instance where ethical standards were tested due to tight deadlines or budget constraints?
user: On several projects, we've had extremely tight deadlines. In those situations, there's a lot of pressure to deliver high-quality results quickly. We push the team hard, sometimes leading them to underreport hours to stay within budget. This is where the ethical standards really get tested.
assistant: That's quite insightful. Can you share more about how the team reacts in those moments, and what steps, if any, are taken to address these ethical dilemmas?
user: Team reactions vary; some juniors struggle with the pace, which can be frustrating. We emphasize the importance of meeting deadlines and often have informal talks to remind everyone of what's at stake. As for addressing the dilemmas, we try to focus on efficient work to avoid these situations, but it's a delicate balance.
assistant: Thank you for elaborating on that. Can you describe any specific examples of these informal talks and how they are conducted? What messages are typically communicated during these discussions?
user: These talks are usually brief and happen during team meetings or one-on-one check-ins. The main message is about the importance of meeting deadlines and contributing to the team's success. We also remind the team of the need for efficiency and careful time management to stay within budget constraints.
assistant: I see. Can you think of a particular instance where this approach worked well and helped the team navigate an ethical challenge effectively? Could you share more details about that experience?
user: Yes, there was a project last year with an extremely tight deadline. The team was struggling to keep up. During a team meeting, we had a candid discussion about the importance of efficiency and discipline. Everyone pulled together, prioritized tasks effectively, and managed to meet the deadline without significantly underreporting hours. This approach reinforced our commitment to both performance and ethical standards.
assistant: Thank you for sharing that example. It sounds like strong communication played a key role. How does leadership within your organization typically set the tone for ethical behavior? Can you give an example of a leader who influenced the ethical culture positively or negatively?
user: Leadership sets the tone through formal policies and training, emphasizing ethical behavior. For example, one partner consistently reinforces the importance of integrity during team meetings and recognizes those who uphold ethical standards, which positively influences the culture. However, there are instances when the pressure to meet targets can overshadow these messages, creating a challenging environment for maintaining ethical standards.
assistant: That's interesting. Can you describe a specific situation where the pressure to meet targets overshadowed the ethical messages, and how it affected the team?
user: During a high-stakes audit last year, there was immense pressure to deliver results quickly. The emphasis on meeting deadlines led some team members to cut corners and underreport hours to stay within budget. Despite the formal policies and training, the immediate need to meet targets overshadowed the ethical standards, causing stress and ethical dilemmas within the team.
assistant: That sounds like a tough situation. In your day-to-day work, how do you personally navigate these kinds of ethical pressures? Are there particular strategies or practices that you have found effective?
user: I focus on prioritizing tasks, setting clear expectations, and encouraging open communication. While the pressure is always there, maintaining a realistic view of what's achievable helps. Keeping the team aligned and supporting them to work efficiently can mitigate the need for compromising ethical standards.
assistant: Thank you. Could you share an example of a recent decision you made where ethical considerations were a significant factor? How did you approach it?
user: Recently, we had to decide whether to sign off on a project that was nearly complete but had some unresolved issues due to time constraints. The ethical consideration was whether to push it through quickly or take additional time to address the issues thoroughly. We decided to take the extra time to ensure the work met our quality and ethical standards, even though it meant missing the original deadline. This decision was communicated transparently to the client, who appreciated our commitment to integrity.
assistant: That's a commendable decision. How did the client’s appreciation impact your team's morale and perspective on maintaining ethical standards in challenging situations?
user: The client's appreciation boosted the team's morale significantly. It reinforced the value of maintaining high ethical standards and demonstrated that integrity ultimately benefits client relationships. This positive feedback encouraged the team to continue prioritizing quality and ethical considerations, even under pressure.
assistant: It's great to hear that the positive feedback had such an uplifting effect on the team's morale. More broadly, how do formal mechanisms like codes of conduct or reporting channels play a role in reinforcing ethical behavior in your organization? Are there any examples where these mechanisms made a difference?
user: Formal mechanisms like codes of conduct and reporting channels are fundamental in reinforcing ethical behavior. They provide clear guidelines and a framework for action. One example is our anonymous reporting hotline, which was used to highlight some discrepancies in a project. This led to an internal review and ultimately reinforced our commitment to transparency and integrity, showing that these mechanisms can be effectively utilized to uphold ethical standards.
assistant: Thank you for sharing that example. Reflecting on our conversation about organizational culture, leadership influence, and formal mechanisms, do you feel there are any additional aspects regarding ethics in your organization that we haven't covered yet, but should?
user: We've covered most critical aspects, but it's worth noting the role of continuous training and development in reinforcing ethical standards. Regular workshops and refreshers can help keep ethics top of mind, ensuring everyone is up-to-date and aligned with the firm's values and expectations.
assistant: Thank you very much for your answers! Looking back at this interview, how well does it summarize the ethical side of your organization’s culture:
1 (poorly), 2 (partially), 3 (well), 4 (very well).

Please reply with just the number.
user: 3
assistant: In your own role, are there ways you think you could strengthen or improve the ethical culture where you work?
user: Encouraging more open communication, providing additional support for juniors, and regularly emphasizing the importance of ethical standards during high-pressure situations could strengthen the ethical culture.
assistant: Those are valuable strategies. Have you already taken any specific actions to encourage open communication or provide additional support to juniors? If so, can you share a recent example?
user: I’ve started holding more frequent one-on-one check-ins with juniors to address their concerns and provide guidance. For instance, during a recent project, I spent extra time with a junior team member to help them understand complex issues and encourage them to ask questions without hesitation, which improved their performance and understanding of ethical practices.
assistant: That sounds very proactive and supportive. Looking ahead, are there any other actions you believe you could take to further enhance the ethical culture in your organization?
user: Increasing collaboration across teams, implementing more regular ethical training sessions, and continuing to recognize and reward ethical behavior could further enhance the ethical culture.
assistant: It sounds like you have some solid ideas for fostering ethical behavior. Thinking more broadly, what could companies do to cultivate a more ethical organizational culture in general?
user: Companies could foster a more ethical culture by setting clear expectations, providing ongoing training, encouraging open communication, and holding everyone accountable for their actions. Recognizing and rewarding ethical behavior can also reinforce the importance of maintaining high ethical standards.
assistant: Thank you for that perspective. Are there any specific practices or programs from other companies or industries that you think could be beneficial to adopt in your organization to strengthen its ethical culture?
user: Utilizing continuous improvement programs from industries like manufacturing, where ethics and quality are deeply intertwined, could be beneficial. Implementing mentorship programs and ethics hotlines, as seen in some leading tech companies, might also enhance ethical standards and provide additional support.
assistant: Those are indeed some insightful suggestions. Before we wrap up, is there any other aspect related to fostering an ethical culture within organizations that you think we should discuss?
user: I think we've covered the main aspects, but continuous improvement and adaptability to new ethical challenges should also be emphasized to ensure a resilient and up-to-date ethical culture.
assistant: Thank you for participating in the interview, this was the last question. Please continue with the remaining sections in the survey part. Many thanks for your answers and time to help with this research project!
