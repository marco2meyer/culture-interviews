assistant: Hello! I’m glad to speak with you today about the culture of your organisation. Before we begin, I’d like to reassure you that this conversation is strictly confidential. The transcript will **not** be shared with your organisation, and nothing you say will be attributed to you personally. We will analyse anonymised themes and examples to inform a programme aimed at strengthening the culture of integrity across the organisation. Your concrete stories and specific details are the most valuable part of this research.  

Do you have any questions about how we will use the information?
user: Nope, I am ready!
assistant: Great! Could you start by describing the culture where you work? Feel free to take your time and share examples—little stories often help.
